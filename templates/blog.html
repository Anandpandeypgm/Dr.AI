                        <p class="card-text">In the age of technology and information, access to accurate and timely healthcare is more critical than ever. With the increasing importance of remote healthcare solutions, we embarked on a journey to develop a symptom-based disease diagnosis web application. Leveraging Flask for the backend and a Decision Tree Classifier model, we created a user-friendly platform that can help users identify potential illnesses based on their reported symptoms.</p>

                        <h3 class="card-title">The Problem</h3>
                        <p class="card-text">The project began with recognizing a common issue: people often experience symptoms and want quick answers about their health concerns. It can be challenging to differentiate between various diseases, especially when symptoms overlap. Our goal was to provide a convenient solution for users to input their symptoms and receive potential diagnoses.</p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                        <h3 class="card-title">The Solution</h3>
                        <p class="card-text">We developed a web app that allows users to enter a list of symptoms they are experiencing. The app then uses a pre-trained Decision Tree Classifier model to predict the most likely disease based on the provided symptoms. Here's how it works:</p>
                        <ol class="card-text">
                            <li><strong>Symptom Input:</strong> Users enter their symptoms through a user-friendly interface. The web app supports a wide range of symptoms, making it versatile for different scenarios.</li>
                            <li><strong>Machine Learning Model:</strong> We trained a Decision Tree Classifier using a dataset containing symptoms and corresponding diseases. The model is capable of predicting diseases based on input symptoms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> The app uses the model to predict the most likely disease, providing users with instant information about potential health concerns.</li>
                            <li><strong>Additional Information:</strong> To enhance user experience, the app also provides additional information about the predicted disease. This includes a description of the disease, recommended precautions, medications, dietary advice, and workout tips.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3 class="card-title">Key Features</h3>
                        <ul class="card-text">
                            <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> The web app boasts an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface, ensuring that users can input their symptoms without any hassle.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accurate Predictions:</strong> Leveraging machine learning, our model provides accurate disease predictions based on the symptoms provided by the user.</li>
                            <li><strong>Comprehensive Information:</strong> In addition to predictions, the app offers comprehensive information about the predicted disease, including descriptions, precautions, medications, diet recommendations, and workout tips.</li>
                            <li><strong>Educational Content:</strong> To empower users with knowledge, the app includes informative blog posts about various health topics.</li>
